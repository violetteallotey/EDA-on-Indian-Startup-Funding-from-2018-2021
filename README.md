# EDA on Indian Startup Funding from 2018 to 2021
## Exploratory Data Analysis Project -- Indian Start-up Funding Analysis

In this project, I explored the funding to Indian start-ups from 2018 to 2021 to help my hypothetical team and potential investors trying to venture into the Indian start-up ecosystem make an informed decision.

I used Python and Jupyter notebook for this project.

## Column names and description:
Company/Brand: Name of the start-up.Object.

Founded: Year start-up was founded. Object.

Headquarter: Administrative centre. Object

Sector: Sector of operation. Object.

What it does: Description of Company. Object.

Founders: Founders of the Company. Object.

Investor: Investors. Object.

Amount($): Funds raised. Float.

Stage: Round of funding. Object.

## Hypothesis
H0: Low risk start-ups tend to attract higher investors

H1: High risk start-ups tend to deflect investors interest or attract lower funding.

In line with the above, several questions were asked and some findings made accordingly.

## Conclusion
The majority of start-ups in India revolve around technology, with the majority of them being FINTECHS.

In India, finance and location are positively associated. If we locate our startup in Bangalore, there is a strong likelihood that we will find finance quickly.

We should anticipate more funding in a given year the more start-ups there are.

Investors favor the seed stage of a business.
